MATRIX REPRESENTATION: Using the optrees and igraph package, create a functino that takes a matrix and converts the matrix into an adjacency list.

EUCLIDEAN MINIMUM SPANNING TREE: Using the function above, find the euclidean distance between all points in the matrix given above. Use the 
msTreeKruskal() function to determine the minimum spanning tree from the given nodes, tails, and euclidean distances (weights). Plot the tree.

HOSTILE AGENTS: Discuss a given question and the possible answer (no code necessary).

PROJECT SCHEDULING: Given a set of tasks, predecessor tasks, and completion times, determine the critical path for the project completion, as well as 
any slack times. Through a set of instructions, calculate the various components that would be calculated in a PERT diagram. Place all values in a matrix.
